Write a program that asks the user for a weight in kilograms and converts it to pounds. There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram.
 
Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers (use three separate input statements). Create variables called total and average that hold the sum and average of the three numbers and print out the values of total and average.
 
Write a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, . . . , 83, 86, 89.
 
Write a program that asks the user for their name and how many times to print it. The program should print out the userâ€™s name the specified number of times.
 
Use a for loop to print a triangle like the one below. Allow the user to specify how high the triangle should be.

Generate a random number between 1 and 10. Ask the user to guess the number and print a message based on whether they get it right or not.
 
Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints Close if the numbers are within .001 of each other and Not close otherwise.
 
Write a program that asks the user to enter a word and prints out whether that word contains any vowels.
 
Write a program that asks the user to enter two strings of the same length. The program should then check to see if the strings are of the same length. If they are not, the program should print an appropriate message and exit. If they are of the same length, the program should alternate the characters of the two strings. For example, if the user enters abcde and ABCDE the program should print out AaBbCcDdEe.
 
Write a program that asks the user for a large integer and inserts commas into it according to the standard American convention for commas in large numbers. For instance, if the user enters 1000000, the output should be 1,000,000.
 
In algebraic expressions, the symbol for multiplication is often left out, as in 3x+4y or 3(x+5). Computers prefer those expressions to include the multiplication symbol, like 3*x+4*y or 3*(x+5). Write a program that asks the user for an algebraic expression and then inserts multiplication symbols where appropriate.
 
Write a program that generates a list of 20 random numbers between 1 and 100.
(a) Print the list.
(b) Print the average of the elements in the list.
(c) Print the largest and smallest values in the list.
(d) Print the second largest and second smallest entries in the list
(e) Print how many even numbers are in the list.
 
Write a program that asks the user for an integer and creates a list that consists of the factors of that integer.
 
Write a program that generates 100 random integers that are either 0 or 1. Then find the longest run of zeros, the largest number of zeros in a row. For instance, the longest run of zeros in [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] is 4.
 
Write a program that removes any repeated items from a list so that each item appears at most once. For instance, the list [1,1,2,3,4,3,0,0] would become [1,2,3,4,0].
 
Write a program that asks the user to enter a length in feet. The program should then give the user the option to convert from feet into inches, yards, miles, millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. Say if the user enters a 1, then the program converts to inches, if they enter a 2, then the program converts to yards, etc. While this can be done with if statements,it is much shorter with lists and it is also easier to add new conversions if you use lists.
 
Write a function called sum_digits that is given an integer num and returns the sum of the digits of num.
