'''
Write a class called Product. The class should have fields called name,
amount, and price, holding the productâ€™s name, the number of items of
that product in stock, and the regular price of the product.
There should be a method get_price that receives the number of
items to be bought and returns a the cost of buying that many items,
where the regular price is charged for orders of less than 10 items,
a 10% discount is applied for orders of between 10 and 99 items, and
a 20% discount is applied for orders of 100 or more items.
There should also be a method called make_purchase that receives the
number of items to be bought and decreases amount by that much.
